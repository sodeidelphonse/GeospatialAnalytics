# Choropleth map of the air pollution in Africa

This code provides users with the workflow to extract and map the air pollution level (i.e. the fine particulate matter concentration of size 2.5 microns) from the **World Bank Open Data** website available [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3). We directly extracted the data using the World Bank data API implemented in the *webstats* package.
