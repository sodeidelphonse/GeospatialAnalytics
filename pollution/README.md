# Choropleth map of the air pollution in Africa
This code provides users with the workflow to extract and map the air pollution level from the **World Bank Open Data** website available \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3}{here}. We directly extract the data using the API implemented in the *webstats* package.
